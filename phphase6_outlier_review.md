## Phase 6 – Outlier Review & Remediation

**Summary:**  
Annotated the top 20 outliers by absolute residual.  
Key patterns:
- Caps and penalties are not strict/nuanced enough for short or long trips.
- No anti-abuse for fake/implausible trips (e.g. 1-day, 1000+ miles).
- True system may give bonuses/relaxed caps for long, high-mileage trips.

**Action Items:**  
- Add/strengthen receipt caps for all trip durations, especially strict for short/medium trips.
- Penalize or block implausible trips (1 day, very high miles).
- Add “bonus”/relaxed cap for trips with both many days and miles.
- Re-run outlier review after code changes.
