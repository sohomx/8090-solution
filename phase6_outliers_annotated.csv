14.0,481.0,939.99,877.17,2060.4,1183.23,"Cap/penalty not strict enough for long trips with moderate receipts; should likely cap or penalize after 8+ days (see 'vacation penalty' rule in cheat_sheet.md)."
4.0,69.0,2321.49,322.0,1472.17,1150.17,"Missing cap on receipts: High spend on short trip, predicted way too high. Need hard upper cap for receipts regardless of days (see receipts cap logic)."
14.0,1020.0,1201.75,2337.73,1200.0,-1137.73,"Over-capped for long trip: Hard cap is too aggressive for long, high-mileage trips; expected output suggests either a different allowance or manual override (possible exception, see interviews.md)."
1.0,1082.0,1809.49,446.94,1531.75,1084.81,"Unrealistic 1-day, high miles: Model should penalize fake trips (very high mileage for 1 day); missing a sanity check or anti-abuse penalty."
9.0,1155.0,1346.4,2248.12,1200.0,-1048.12,"Cap too harsh for long trip: True output is much higher than predicted; maybe there's a bonus for long, high-mile trips or cap should be relaxed when miles >1000."
5.0,516.0,1878.49,669.85,1712.25,1042.4,"No receipts cap for medium trip: Model reimburses too much when receipts are extreme, needs a secondary cap for 4–6 day trips (see 'sweet spot' but add cap)."
14.0,1122.0,1766.25,2239.35,1200.0,-1039.35,"Cap too strict at extreme duration+miles: Again, model over-penalizes long/high-mile trips. Check if there's a 'max cap per day' or per trip, or missing exception logic."
4.0,286.0,1063.49,418.17,1438.75,1020.58,"Medium trip, too high reimbursement: Should apply the soft/hard cap to receipts at ~$1000, model is too generous."
13.0,1140.0,1607.8,2214.64,1200.0,-1014.64,"Long trip, over-capped: Again, model’s cap logic not nuanced enough; actual system may allow more when both days and miles are high."
8.0,1025.0,1031.33,2214.64,1200.0,-1014.64,"'Vacation penalty' or manual override: Predicted capped, but true payout is higher. Possible legacy logic or exception for 8+ day trips."
5.0,195.73,1228.49,511.23,1519.14,1007.91,"Extreme receipts for short trip: Receipts cap should kick in, model misses this; add stricter rule for max reimbursable receipts per day."
13.0,1167.0,1074.36,2197.33,1200.0,-997.33,"Cap logic issue: Same as above; long, high-mile trips seem underpaid by model, but real system pays more — check for missing mileage or trip-length bonus."
9.0,1182.0,1342.24,2164.15,1200.0,-964.15,"Mileage/duration bonus missing: Real system probably gives extra for sustained long trips; model just caps. Review cheat_sheet.md for 'efficiency bonus' logic."
12.0,1189.0,1453.16,2162.13,1200.0,-962.13,"Same as above: Big negative residuals in long, high-mile trips — check for missing branching or bonus in model."
13.0,1054.0,1131.25,2162.03,1200.0,-962.03,"Pattern repeats: Cap too aggressive for this trip archetype. Check for tiered cap/bonus logic in interviews."
11.0,1095.0,1071.83,2159.33,1200.0,-959.33,"Another long+high miles edge case: Suspect same logic as above; maybe model needs more piecewise rules for long/high-mile trips."
11.0,1126.0,1593.03,2143.74,1200.0,-943.74,"Edge-case: cap/bonus interaction: Again, check for missing bonus or exception for sustained travel."
11.0,916.0,1036.91,2098.07,1200.0,-898.07,"Efficiency/mileage logic missing: Model likely needs more bonus/piecewise logic for high-mileage, long trips."
13.0,1024.0,1712.85,2097.69,1200.0,-897.69,"High receipts, long trip: Suspect true system allows higher payout when all inputs are high; model doesn’t branch enough."
